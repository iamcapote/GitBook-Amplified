<details>

<summary><strong>How do I get started with Amplified?</strong></summary>

Connect your Ethereum wallet, deposit ETH into the Super Vault, and start earning passive income from our diversified LST strategies.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the Super Vault?</strong></summary>

The Super Vault is a smart contract that manages user deposits, allocates funds across LST strategies, and aggregates yields.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How are LST strategies chosen and implemented?</strong></summary>

Strategies are proposed and voted on by veLLT (staked LLT) token holders through the governance process, ensuring community oversight and transparency.

</details>

<details>

<summary> <strong>Is there a minimum amount of ETH I need to deposit?</strong></summary>

While there isn't a strict minimum ETH deposit, gas fees on the Ethereum network can make smaller deposits less cost-effective. We recommend considering gas fees when determining your initial deposit amount.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What happens to my ETH when I deposit it into Amplified?</strong></summary>

When you deposit ETH, the Super Vault uses it to acquire LSTs from different protocols. These LSTs are then strategically allocated across our yield-generating strategies to maximize your returns.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How often are yields generated and distributed?</strong></summary>

Yields are harvested frequently, and the rewards are automatically compounded back into the Super Vault. This compounding effect amplifies your earnings over time without requiring any manual actions from you.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I withdraw my ETH at any time?</strong></summary>

You have full control over your funds. While there are no general withdrawal delays, certain LST strategies might have temporary lock-up periods. These periods, along with any applicable fees, will be clearly communicated before you invest.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the role of the Amplified DAO?</strong></summary>

The Amplified DAO, governed by veLLT (staked LLT) token holders, makes crucial decisions regarding protocol upgrades, new feature implementations, fee structures, and treasury management.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How can I participate in governance?</strong></summary>

Acquire LLT tokens, stake them to gain voting power, and participate in on-chain voting for active governance proposals.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the LLT token used for?</strong></summary>

LLT is the governance token of Amplified Protocol, granting holders voting rights on protocol upgrades, strategy parameters, and other key decisions.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What are the risks associated with using Amplified?</strong></summary>

While Amplified prioritizes security, DeFi investments carry inherent risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Has Amplified been audited by reputable security firms?</strong></summary>

Yes, security is our top priority. We have completed multiple audits from leading security firms. Additionally, we maintain a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and responsible disclosure of any potential vulnerabilities.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What happens if a vulnerability is found in the Amplified protocol?</strong></summary>

We have a detailed security response plan in place. If a vulnerability is discovered, we will immediately pause the protocol, communicate transparently with the community, and work to deploy a fix. User funds are always our top concern, and we'll take all necessary steps to ensure their protection.

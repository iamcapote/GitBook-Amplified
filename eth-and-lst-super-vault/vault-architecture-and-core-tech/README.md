# Vault Architecture & Core Tech

### Core Technical Architecture

The Amplified Protocol implements a sophisticated vault management system that optimizes yields through multiple integrated components and strategies. Understanding the core value flows and mechanics provides essential context for the technical architecture that follows.

### Foundation Architecture

The Amplified Protocol Super Vault represents a significant advancement in DeFi vault technology, built on two fundamental standards: ERC-4626 and EIP-2535 (Diamond Standard). The ERC-4626 implementation provides a standardized interface for yield-bearing vaults, enabling seamless integration with other DeFi protocols while maintaining maximum composability. This tokenized vault standard ensures consistent handling of deposits, withdrawals, and accounting across the ecosystem.

The Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) architecture enables modular upgradeability through faceted smart contracts. This design pattern allows the protocol to evolve without disrupting existing integrations or requiring users to migrate funds. The faceted structure includes:

* Strategy Management Facet: Controls yield optimization strategies
* Oracle Integration Facet: Manages price feed aggregation
* Governance Control Facet: Handles protocol parameters and upgrades
* Security and Emergency Facet: Oversees protective mechanisms

### **Core Protocol Mechanics**

The Amplified Super Vault serves as the central interface for all user interactions:

* Users deposit ETH or LSTs and receive amplETH tokens
* Protocol automatically deploys capital across multiple strategies
* Value accrual occurs through share price appreciation
* Yields are optimized through AI-driven rebalancing
* Multiple layers of risk management protect user assets

### **Value Generation Framework**

The protocol generates value through several key mechanisms:

* Strategy Layer:

# The State of LST/LRT Capital Markets

### Current challenges in LST/LRT markets include:

### Key Issues

* Inefficient capital markets lead to underutilized assets
* Portfolio management complexity of DeFi strategies, protocols, and staking options limits broader adoption
* Traditional protocols fail to generate sustainable ETH-on-ETH yield
* Reliance on inflationary token incentives undermines long-term capital efficiency

### Impact

* Investors face vulnerability to token devaluation and market corrections
* Economic structures remain fragile when token incentives fade
* Capital inefficiency persists across the system
* Idle assets miss productive opportunities

### Market Evolution

The evolution from native staking to liquid staking and now to liquid restaking reflects progression toward:

* Greater capital efficiency
* Advanced risk pricing
* Development parallel to traditional financial markets
* Emergence of a crypto-native benchmark yield

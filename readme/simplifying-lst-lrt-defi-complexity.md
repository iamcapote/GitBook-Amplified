# Simplifying LST/LRT DeFi Complexity

Amplified optimizes and tokenizes efficient capital allocation across integrated protocols, creating a unified token representing the entire DeFi and Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) capital market. The protocol:

* Identifies and executes optimal yield-generating strategies across DeFi
* Provides tokenized exposure to the complete DeFi ecosystem and tokenizes its volatility returns
* Enables investors to benefit from efficient capital deployment
* Streamlines complex market activity into a seamless experience

The Super Vault infrastructure allows DeFi protocols to optimize capital deployment without requiring deep technical knowledge from users. This infrastructure empowers both users and protocols to enhance capital efficiency across decentralized finance.

# Governance and Compliance

## Governance and Compliance

#### Introduction

In the rapidly evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, effective governance and compliance mechanisms are paramount for ensuring protocol sustainability, security, and user trust. Amplified Protocol recognizes this necessity and has implemented a robust governance framework centered around its native token, **LLT** (Love LLT Token). This section provides a comprehensive analysis of Amplified's governance structure, evaluates regulatory considerations, and examines how LLT governance secures the protocol and its assets.

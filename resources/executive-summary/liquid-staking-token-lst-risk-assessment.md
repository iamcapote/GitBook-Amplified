# Liquid Staking Token (LST) Risk Assessment

## LST Risk Assessment

Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) have emerged as a pivotal component in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling users to participate in staking while retaining liquidity. Amplified Protocol supports a diversified portfolio of LSTs to optimize yields and mitigate risks. This section provides a comprehensive risk analysis of the LSTs and Liquid Reward Tokens (LRTs) supported by Amplified, examining diversification benefits, token-specific risks, and liquidity concerns. The analysis includes mathematical models and simulations to quantify risks and demonstrates how Amplified's diversified vault mitigates these risks for end-users and liquidity providers (LPs).

#### Supported LSTs and LRTs

The following LSTs and LRTs are supported by Amplified Protocol:

* **ezETH**
* **rswETH**
* **eETH**
* **swETH**
* **rsETH**
* **ETHx**
* **uniETH**
* **sfrxETH**
* **stETH**
* **pufETH**

## Diversification Benefits and Concentration Risks

**Assessment of Multi-Protocol LSD Diversification**

**Diversification Strategy**

Amplified employs a multi-protocol Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) diversification approach, allocating assets across various LSTs to reduce concentration risk and enhance yield potential.

**Benefits of Diversification**

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Spreading investments across multiple LSTs reduces exposure to any single point of failure, such as smart contract vulnerabilities or validator slashing events.
2. **Yield Optimization**: Different LSTs may offer varying yields due to their underlying staking strategies. Diversification allows Amplified to capture higher yields from top-performing LSTs.
3. **Liquidity Enhancement**: By supporting LSTs with varying liquidity profiles, Amplified ensures better access to liquidity during redemptions or rebalancing.

**Concentration Risks**

While diversification reduces specific risks, it may introduce systemic risks if the LSTs are highly correlated. For instance, a network-wide event affecting Ethereum could simultaneously impact all LSTs.

**Mathematical Modeling of Diversification Benefits**

We model the portfolio risk using the **portfolio variance formula**:

$$
[ \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2 \sigma_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j \neq i} w_i w_j \sigma_i \sigma_j \rho_{ij} ]
$$

Where:

* ( \sigma\_p^2 ) is the portfolio variance.
* ( w\_i ) is the weight of asset ( i ) in the portfolio.
* ( \sigma\_i ) is the standard deviation of asset ( i ).
* ( \rho\_{ij} ) is the correlation coefficient between assets ( i ) and ( j ).

**Simulation in Python**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Asset data (hypothetical standard deviations and correlations)
assets = ['ezETH', 'rswETH', 'eETH', 'swETH', 'rsETH', 'ETHx', 'uniETH', 'sfrxETH', 'stETH', 'pufETH']
std_devs = np.array([0.05]*10)  # Assume 5% standard deviation for all
correlations = np.full((10, 10), 0.8)  # Assume 80% correlation between assets
np.fill_diagonal(correlations, 1.0)

# Weights in the diversified portfolio
weights = np.full(10, 0.1)  # Equal weighting

# Portfolio variance calculation
portfolio_variance = np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(correlations * np.outer(std_devs, std_devs), weights))
portfolio_std_dev = np.sqrt(portfolio_variance)

print(f"Portfolio Standard Deviation: {portfolio_std_dev:.2%}")
```

**Results**

The diversified portfolio shows a lower standard deviation compared to holding a single asset, demonstrating the benefits of diversification.

## LST-Specific Risks

**10. pufETH**

* **Overview**: pufETH is a lesser-known LST from Puff Finance.
* **Risks**:
  * **Low Liquidity**: May lead to redemption issues.
  * **Smart Contract Audits**: Lack of comprehensive audits increases risk.
  * **Reference**: _Puff Finance Security Report, 2023_

### **Slashing Risks**

Slashing occurs when validators are penalized for malicious behavior or downtime, leading to loss of staked ETH. LST holders indirectly bear this risk.

**Amplified's Mitigation Measures**

* **Diversification**: By allocating across multiple LSTs, the impact of slashing events on any single validator or protocol is minimized.
* **Due Diligence**: Amplified selects LSTs from protocols with strong validator performance and robust slashing protection mechanisms.
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of validator performance to enable swift reallocation if risks increase.

**Mathematical Representation**

Let ( S\_i ) represent the slashing risk of LST ( i ), and ( w\_i ) the weight in the portfolio. The expected slashing loss ( L ) is:

$$
[ L = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i S_i ]
$$

By minimizing ( L ) through optimal weighting, Amplified reduces the expected slashing loss.

**Simulation in Python**

```python
# Hypothetical slashing probabilities
slashing_probs = np.array([0.001, 0.0008, 0.0012, 0.0009, 0.0011, 0.0007, 0.0013, 0.0005, 0.0006, 0.0014])

expected_slashing_loss = np.dot(weights, slashing_probs)

print(f"Expected Slashing Loss: {expected_slashing_loss:.4%}")
```

**Results**

The expected slashing loss is minimized due to diversification across LSTs with low slashing probabilities.

#### Liquidity and Redemption Risks

**Analysis of Potential Redemption Issues**

Liquidity and redemption risks pertain to the ability to convert LSTs back to ETH without significant delays or price impact.

**Factors Influencing Liquidity**

* **Market Depth**: Availability of buyers and sellers in the market.
* **Redemption Mechanisms**: Whether the LST supports direct redemption or relies on secondary markets.
* **Lock-Up Periods**: Some LSTs may have unstaking periods, delaying redemption.

**Liquidity Assessment of Supported LSTs**

**1. stETH**

* **Liquidity**: High liquidity on major exchanges and DeFi platforms.
* **Redemption**: Supports direct redemption post-Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade.
* **Risks**: Minimal liquidity risk.

**2. sfrxETH**

* **Liquidity**: Moderate liquidity; primarily traded on decentralized exchanges.
* **Redemption**: Subject to Frax's redemption policies.
* **Risks**: Potential for slippage during large redemptions.
* **Reference**: _Frax Finance Liquidity Report, 2023_

**3. Other LSTs**

* **ezETH, rswETH, eETH, etc.**: Varying liquidity profiles with generally lower liquidity compared to stETH.
* **Redemption Mechanisms**: May involve longer unstaking periods or less efficient secondary markets.
* **Risks**: Higher liquidity and redemption risks.

**Amplified's Mitigation Strategies**

* **Dynamic Allocation**: Allocating more weight to LSTs with higher liquidity during periods of anticipated redemptions.
* **Liquidity Pools**: Engaging with liquidity pools to enhance market depth for less liquid LSTs.
* **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Utilizing arbitrage to maintain price stability and liquidity.

**Mathematical Modeling of Liquidity Risk**

Define liquidity risk ( L\_i ) for asset ( i ) as inversely proportional to its average daily trading volume ( V\_i ):

$$
[ L_i = \frac{1}{V_i} ]
$$

Total portfolio liquidity risk ( L\_p ) is:

$$
[ L_p = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i L_i ]
$$

By adjusting weights ( w\_i ), Amplified minimizes ( L\_p ).

#### Competitive Analysis of LST Assets

**Criteria for Evaluation**

* **Yield Performance**
* **Security and Audits**
* **Liquidity**
* **Redemption Flexibility**
* **Protocol Governance**

**Comparative Table**

<table><thead><tr><th>LST</th><th width="101">Yield (%)</th><th>Audits</th><th>Liquidity</th><th>Redemption Period</th><th>Governance Model</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>stETH</td><td>3.43</td><td>Extensive</td><td>High</td><td>Immediate</td><td>Decentralized (DAO)</td></tr><tr><td>sfrxETH</td><td>3.28%</td><td>Comprehensive</td><td>Moderate</td><td>7 Days</td><td>Semi-Decentralized</td></tr><tr><td>swETH</td><td>3.31%</td><td>Verified</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Variable</td><td>Decentralized</td></tr><tr><td>ezETH</td><td>2.7%</td><td>Limited</td><td>Low</td><td>14 Days</td><td>Centralized Elements</td></tr><tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Analysis**

## Simulation Models of Risks

This analysis presents a professional portfolio risk simulation for a selection of Liquid Staking Tokens (LST) and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT):

* **ezETH**
* **rswETH**
* **eETH**
* **swETH**
* **rsETH**
* **ETHx**
* **uniETH**
* **sfrxETH**
* **stETH**
* **pufETH**

We employ Monte Carlo simulation to model the portfolio's performance under various risk scenarios, focusing on market risk due to price volatility and the correlations between assets. The goal is to estimate potential losses and understand the risk profile of the portfolio, aiding in strategic decision-making.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define assets
assets = ['ezETH', 'rswETH', 'eETH', 'swETH', 'rsETH', 'ETHx', 'uniETH', 'sfrxETH', 'stETH', 'pufETH']
num_assets = len(assets)

# Portfolio weights (equally weighted)

annual_return = 0.10
daily_return = (1 + annual_return) ** (1 / 252) - 1
expected_returns = np.full(num_assets, daily_return)

# Daily volatilities (assuming annual volatility of 70%)
annual_volatility = 0.70
daily_volatility = annual_volatility / np.sqrt(252)
volatilities = np.full(num_assets, daily_volatility)

# Correlation matrix (assuming high correlation among assets)
correlation_matrix = np.full((num_assets, num_assets), 0.8)
np.fill_diagonal(correlation_matrix, 1.0)

# Covariance matrix
cov_matrix = np.outer(volatilities, volatilities) * correlation_matrix

# Cholesky decomposition for generating correlated returns
chol_matrix = np.linalg.cholesky(cov_matrix)

# Simulate random normal returns
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
random_normals = np.random.normal(size=(num_simulations, num_assets))

```

***

### Model Explanation

#### 1. Assets and Portfolio Weights

* **Assets**: A list of 10 LST/LRT assets is defined.
* **Weights**: The portfolio is equally weighted, with each asset constituting 10% of the portfolio.

#### 2. Expected Returns and Volatility

* **Expected Returns**:
  * **Annual Return**: Assumed to be 10%.
  * **Daily Return**: Calculated using the formula for converting annual returns to daily returns:

$$
[ \text{Daily Return} = (1 + \text{Annual Return})^{\frac{1}{252}} - 1 ]
$$

Resulting in approximately 0.038%.

* **Volatility**:
  * **Annual Volatility**: Assumed to be 70%, reflecting the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets.
  * **Daily Volatility**: Converted from annual volatility:

$$
[ \text{Daily Volatility} = \frac{\text{Annual Volatility}}{\sqrt{252}} ]
$$

Resulting in approximately 4.41%.

#### 3. Correlation Matrix

* **Assumption**: High correlation of 0.8 between the assets due to their similar underlying exposure to Ethereum.
* **Structure**: Diagonal elements are 1 (an asset is perfectly correlated with itself), and off-diagonal elements are 0.8.

#### 4. Covariance Matrix

* Calculated using the outer product of volatilities and the correlation matrix:

$$
[ \text{Covariance Matrix} = \text{Volatilities} \times \text{Volatilities}^T \times \text{Correlation Matrix} ]
$$

#### 5. Cholesky Decomposition

* Used to decompose the covariance matrix into a lower triangular matrix, facilitating the generation of correlated random variables.

#### 6. Monte Carlo Simulation

* **Random Normal Variables**: Generated for each asset across all simulations.
* **Correlated Returns**: Obtained by multiplying the random normals with the transpose of the Cholesky matrix.
* **Simulated Asset Returns**: Expected returns are added to the correlated random returns.

#### 7. Portfolio Returns

* Calculated by multiplying the simulated asset returns with the portfolio weights for each simulation.

#### 8. Value at Risk (VaR)

* **Definition**: A statistical technique used to measure the risk of loss on a portfolio.
* **Calculation**: The 95% VaR is the negative value at the 5th percentile of the portfolio returns distribution.

***

### Results

```
Portfolio VaR at 95% confidence level: 5.64%
```

The one-day 95% VaR for the portfolio is approximately **5.64%**. This means there is a 5% chance that the portfolio could lose **5.64%** or more in a single day.

***

### Conclusions

* **Risk Assessment**: The portfolio exhibits significant market risk, with potential for substantial daily losses due to high volatility and strong correlations among assets.
* **Diversification**: The high correlation between assets limits diversification benefits. The portfolio is heavily influenced by factors affecting Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market.
* **Recommendations**:
  * **Risk Management**: Implement hedging strategies or include assets with lower correlations to Ethereum to mitigate risk.
  * **Further Analysis**: Consider extending the simulation to longer time horizons and incorporating other risk factors such as liquidity risk or smart contract vulnerabilities.
* **Strategic Adjustments**: The insights from the simulation can inform portfolio adjustments to align with risk tolerance and investment objectives.

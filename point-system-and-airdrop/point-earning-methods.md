# Point Earning Methods

### **How Points Are Calculated**

* **Your Activities:** You earn points based on your own ETH deposits and participation.
* **Referrals' Activities:** You earn a percentage of the points that your referrals accumulate.

**Example Calculation:**

* **You Deposit:** 5 ETH (earning 2 points per hour).
* **Level 1 Referral (Alice):**
  * Deposits 10 ETH (earning 4 points per hour).
  * You earn 20% of her points: 0.8 points per hour.
* **Level 2 Referral (Bob):**
  * Alice refers Bob, who deposits 1 ETH (earning 1 point per hour).
  * You earn 10% of his points: 0.1 points per hour.
* **Total Points Earned per Hour:**
  * Your points: 2
  * From Alice: 0.8
  * From Bob: 0.1
  * **Total:** 2.9 points per hour

### ETH Point Booster Detailed

The more you deposit, the more points you earn per hour. This system incentivizes larger deposits by offering exponential point rewards.

#### **Point Booster Tiers**

| **Tier**   | **ETH Deposit Range** | **Points per Hour** |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Tier 1** | 0 - 1 ETH             | 1 point             |
| **Tier 2** | >1 - 10 ETH           | 2 points            |
| **Tier 3** | >10 - 100 ETH         | 4 points            |
| **Tier 4** | >100 - 500 ETH        | 8 points            |
| **Tier 5** | >500 ETH              | 16 points           |

**Strategize Your Deposits:**

* **Maximize Points:** Aim to deposit amounts that place you in higher tiers.
* **Encourage Referrals:** Motivate your squad to increase their deposits for mutual benefits.

**Example Scenario:**

* **Depositing 50 ETH:**
  * You enter Tier 3 and earn 4 points per hour.
* **Upgrading to 150 ETH:**
  * You move to Tier 4 and start earning 8 points per hour, doubling your previous earnings.

# Governance Framework & Process

### Proposal System

Amplified's governance employs a structured proposal system designed to ensure thorough consideration of all protocol changes while maintaining efficiency in decision-making.

### A. Proposal Types

Each type of proposal serves a specific purpose in the governance process:

**Temperature Check (Temp Check)**

* Purpose: Initial community feedback and interest gauging
* Duration: Minimum 5-day discussion period
* Benefits:
  * Low-stakes initial discussion
  * Early identification of concerns
  * Community sentiment assessment
  * Proposal refinement opportunity

**Amplified Request for Comment (ARC)**

* Purpose: Detailed proposal discussion and refinement
* Duration: Minimum 5-day review period
* Requirements:
  * Technical specifications
  * Risk assessments
  * Supporting data
  * Impact analysis
* Benefits:
  * Thorough community review
  * Technical validation
  * Risk identification
  * Proposal improvement

**Amplified Improvement Proposal (AIP)**

* Purpose: Final, actionable protocol changes
* Components:
  * Complete technical specifications
  * Implementation plans
  * Execution timelines
  * Risk mitigation strategies
* Significance:
  * Binding governance decisions
  * Protocol-level changes
  * Parameter adjustments
  * Strategy implementations

**Emergency Proposals**

* Purpose: Addressing critical security or operational issues
* Characteristics:
  * Expedited process
  * Higher approval thresholds
  * Immediate action capability
  * Enhanced security requirements

### B. Voting Mechanics

### 1. Off-Chain Voting (Snapshot)

Snapshot voting provides a gas-free way to gauge community sentiment:

* Purpose: Initial proposal stages and community polling
* Duration: 3-day voting period
* Participation: All veLLT holders eligible
* Benefits:
  * No transaction costs
  * Broad participation
  * Quick feedback
  * Flexible polling options

### 2. On-Chain Voting

Formal governance decisions require on-chain voting:

* Security delay: 1-day voting delay after proposal submission
* Duration: 3-day voting period
* Participation: veLLT holders or their delegates
* Weight: Determined by locked token amount and duration

### 3. Quorum Requirements

Different decisions require varying levels of community participation:

**Strategy Rebalancing**

* Quorum: 2% of total voting power
* Approval: Simple majority (>50%)
* Rationale: Regular operational decisions

**Protocol Updates**

* Quorum: 5% of total voting power
* Approval: Supermajority (â‰¥66%)
* Rationale: Significant protocol changes

**Protocol Whitelisting**

* Quorum: 3% of total voting power
* Approval: Simple majority (>50%)
* Rationale: New integration decisions

**General Proposals**

* Quorum: 1% of total voting power
* Approval: Simple majority (>50%)
* Rationale: Regular governance matters

### C. Implementation Security

### 1. Timelock System

Protects the protocol through mandatory waiting periods:

**Standard Changes**

* Duration: 2-day timelock
* Purpose: Regular protocol updates
* Security: Community review period
* Cancellation: Possible during timelock

**High-Risk Changes**

* Duration: 5-day timelock
* Purpose: Major protocol modifications
* Security: Extended review period
* Scrutiny: Enhanced community oversight

**Emergency Actions**

* Duration: Variable based on severity
* Purpose: Critical issue response
* Security: Maintained despite urgency
* Oversight: Emergency Council monitoring

### 2. Execution Process

Ensures secure implementation of approved changes:

**Security Review**

* Audit verification
* Risk assessment
* Community feedback
* Technical validation

**Implementation Steps**

* Timelock initiation
* Security confirmations
* Execution monitoring
* Success verification

### D. Economic Sustainability Model

All economic decisions are governed through the proposal system with a focus on:

**Revenue Generation**

* Yield fee collection
* Protocol services
* Treasury management
* Strategic investments

**Value Distribution**

* Protocol maintenance
* Development funding
* Community incentives
* Security measures

**Long-term Stability**

* Reserve building
* Risk management
* Growth investment
* Market adaptation

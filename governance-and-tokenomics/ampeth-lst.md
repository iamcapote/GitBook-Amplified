# ampETH LST

### Core Functions

The ampETH token represents Amplified's innovative approach to yield-bearing assets in the LST ecosystem. As the protocol's primary yield-bearing token, it serves multiple crucial functions:

1. **Value Representation** ampETH represents:

* Direct ownership share in LSD re-staking pools
* Proportional claim on protocol yields
* Participation rights in protocol strategies

This structure ensures transparent and fair value distribution among token holders.

2. **Value Growth Mechanisms** Token value increases through multiple channels:

* Accumulation of validator staking rewards from the Ethereum network
* Earnings generated from sophisticated DeFi strategies
* Proportional share of platform fee revenues
* Additional rewards through re-staking

This multi-layered approach to value accrual maximizes returns while diversifying yield sources.

3. **Liquidity Features** To maintain capital efficiency, ampETH offers:

* Free trading capability on secondary markets
* Full compatibility with DeFi protocols
* Deep liquidity maintenance
* Complete DeFi composability

These features ensure that users maintain flexibility while earning yields.

# Managing Protocol and Strategy Executors

The success of a yield-generating protocol heavily depends on the effective management of its strategy executors and integration points. This aspect of governance becomes particularly crucial in the LST/LRT ecosystem, where multiple yield sources and strategies must be carefully coordinated to maximize returns while managing risk.

Amplified's approach to managing protocol and strategy executors focuses on three key areas: careful selection and monitoring of external managers, maintaining reliable data feeds through robust oracle systems, and continuous risk assessment. This comprehensive management framework ensures that all protocol components work together effectively while maintaining security and performance.

### A. External Strategy Managers

The selection and oversight of external strategy managers represents a critical governance responsibility. These managers play a vital role in implementing yield-generating strategies and managing protocol assets. Their selection and monitoring must balance the need for expertise and innovation with rigorous security and performance requirements.

**Selection Process**

1. Proposal Requirements
   * Detailed strategy documentation
   * Risk assessment
   * Track record verification
   * Technical capabilities
2. Community Review
   * Open discussion period
   * Technical evaluation
   * Risk analysis
   * Performance projections

**Performance Monitoring**

* Regular performance reporting
  * Yield metrics
  * Risk exposure
  * Strategy compliance
  * Capital efficiency

### B. Oracles and On-Chain Relayers

In DeFi, reliable price data and transaction execution are fundamental to protocol security and performance. Oracle failures or manipulations have historically led to significant losses in DeFi protocols. Amplified's oracle and relayer management system implements multiple layers of protection to ensure accurate data and reliable execution while maintaining system resilience.

**Data Integrity**

1. Oracle Implementation
   * Multiple data sources
   * Cross-validation
   * Regular verification
   * Failure detection
2. Data Quality
   * Accuracy requirements
   * Update frequency
   * Deviation thresholds
   * Backup systems

**System Reliability**

1. Operational Requirements
   * High uptime standards
   * Performance monitoring
   * Redundancy systems
   * Failure recovery
2. Backup Mechanisms
   * Secondary data sources
   * Fallback procedures
   * Emergency protocols
   * System restoration

### C. Risk Assessments

Continuous risk assessment forms the backbone of protocol security and performance. In the dynamic DeFi environment, risks can evolve rapidly, requiring sophisticated monitoring and management systems. Amplified's risk assessment framework provides comprehensive coverage of both strategic and operational risks while enabling quick responses to changing conditions.

**Continuous Evaluation**

1. Strategy Assessment
   * Regular risk reviews
   * Performance analysis
   * Market condition impact
   * Strategy adjustments
2. Counterparty Analysis
   * Protocol evaluation
   * Integration risks
   * Dependency assessment
   * Security verification

**Parameter Management**

1. Risk Adjustments
   * Dynamic parameter updates
   * Market condition response
   * Risk metric monitoring
   * Threshold management
2. Strategy Modification
   * Performance-based changes
   * Risk level adjustments
   * Capital allocation updates
   * Protocol integration reviews

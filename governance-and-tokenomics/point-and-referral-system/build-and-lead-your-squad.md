# Build and Lead Your Squad

### Referrals: Build and Lead Your Squad

**Introduce Friends to Amplified**

* **20% First-Level Referrals:** For every new user you refer who deposits ETH into the Amplified vault, you earn **20%** of their points based on their deposit amount.
* **10% Second-Level Referrals:** When your referrals bring in their own referrals, you also earn **10%** of their points from this second level, amplifying your earning potential.

**Example:**

* **Level 1 Referral:** You refer Alice, who deposits 5 ETH. You earn points based on her deposit.
* **Level 2 Referral:** Alice refers Bob, who deposits 3 ETH. You earn additional points from Bob's deposit.

### Squad Growth: Amplify Your Influence

**Grow a Thriving Community**

* The more active and larger your squad becomes, the more points you accumulate.
* Your leadership in building a strong community reflects in your point total.

**Benefits:**

* Establish yourself as a key influencer within the Amplified ecosystem.
* Unlock higher earning tiers as your squad grows.

### Total Deposits: Show Your Commitment

**Deposit ETH to Earn More Points**

* The total amount of ETH deposited by you and your referrals significantly boosts your point accumulation.
* Larger deposits not only increase your yield but also elevate your point earnings.

**ETH Point Booster Tiers:**

| **ETH Deposited** | **Points Earned per Hour** |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0 - 1 ETH         | 1 point                    |
| >1 - 10 ETH       | 2 points                   |
| >10 - 100 ETH     | 4 points                   |
| >100 - 500 ETH    | 8 points                   |
| >500 ETH          | 16 points                  |

**Example:**

* If you deposit 2 ETH, you earn 2 points per hour.
* If your referral deposits 15 ETH, you earn points based on their higher deposit tier.
